$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    Description about Project structure   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


- Reports Folder containing screenshots YoloV5_custom training on various epochs.
- Weights - Pretrained weight downloaded from github (https://github.com/clintonoduor/PCB-Defect-Detection-using-Deepstream)
- YoloV5_Training - cloned folder of YoloV5 for custom training (git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- Complete_dataset.zip - Yolo and TFOD data sets are available,
                       - For this project I've used Complete_dataset/Yolo_Complete_dataset/YoloV5 dataset
- fetch_data.ipynb - For downloading PCB_DATASET for TFOD training
- YOLO V5 Custom Training.ipynb -  For Training and detection


Note:
- Working directory will be yolov5 for training YOLOV5
- Train, Validation and Test images with labels are copied to yolov5 folder.



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    Training   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

- For training from scratch follow https://github.com/sudheeshe/YoloV5_Custom_training_template
- For training from model which was already trained for few epochs n order to improve the performance follow the below steps

        1) Make yolov5 as working directory
        2) best model files will be available at yolov5/runs/train in the name of `best.pt`
           eg: runs/train/yolov5s_results2/weights/best.pt

           we can select this model to improve the performance the model.

        3) `python train.py --img 416 --batch 32 --epochs 200 --data data.yaml --cfg models/custom_yolov5s.yaml --weights runs/train/yolov5s_results2/weights/best.pt --name yolov5s_results  --cache`
            run the above to start training the model

- Once the training gets finish the best model and logs will be saved on runs/train/yolov5s_results3



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    Inferencing   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

- run the below code on yolov5 working directory

`python detect.py --weights runs/train/yolov5s_results3/weights/best.pt --img 416 --conf 0.5 --source test/images`

- We can change the confidence(threshold) value on the above code by argument `conf 0.5`

- The predictions will get saved at runs/detect/exp path.
